# Shifting left in mobile application testing is the new norm

For a few years, the mobile application development lifecycle has changed a lot. There is a need for shifting left in testing, meaning that tests need to be conducted often and early to minimize the cost of bugs.

Test automation is more and more becoming the norm in Android development, as it guarantees more robust apps and a faster development lifecycle with earlier bug detection.
When putting in place an automation testing routine, most of the work lies in the design of the tests themselves â€” but crucial decisions are to be taken too in terms of tools involved; and they have a major impact on your operations and project budget:

- Choice of testing framework that will support your tests portfolio

- Choice of the tools around automation: Continuous Integration Server and virtual or real Android devices where the tests will run

- How those tests are being run
