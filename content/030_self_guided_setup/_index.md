# Self-Paced Workshop

Welcome to the Self Guided Setup section! This workshop requires an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don't worry, there's a page that will allow you to request for AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop!

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

1. Access to an AWS account w/ proper permissions
1. Sign-up for Genymotion free trial to use the solution (if necessary)
1. Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
1. Set up the Android environnement on the Cloud9 instance
1. Install jq
